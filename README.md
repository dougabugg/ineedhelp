"I need help" support service website

A good starting point: links to national support hotlines, resolve geolocation.

Eventually? A "chat bot", that mixes simple parsing and prewritten phrases (like ELIZA), but also a more sophisticated model of processing speech and responding. (probably not based on AI/LLM, since I favor determinism). I think there can be therapeutic value in communicating language with a machine, only to have it ask for clarification and if it's understanding you correctly.
